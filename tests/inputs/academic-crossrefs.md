# Cross-References

By [Theorem 1](#thm-max), the maximum is on the boundary.

See [Lemma 2](#lem-bound) and [Definition 3](#def-cont) for details.

The result follows from [Proposition 4](#prop-unique).

From [Equation (1)](#eq-euler), we derive the identity.

As shown in [Algorithm 1](#alg-sort), the complexity is $O(n \log n)$.
