# Theorems

::: {.theorem #thm-max title="Maximum Principle"}
Let $u$ be harmonic on $\Omega$. Then $u$ attains its maximum on the boundary $\partial\Omega$.
:::

::: {.lemma #lem-bound}
For all $x \in [0,1]$, we have $f(x) \leq M$.
:::

::: {.definition #def-cont title="Continuity"}
A function $f$ is continuous at $a$ if $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)$.
:::

::: {.corollary #cor-max}
If $u$ is harmonic and bounded, then $u$ is constant.
:::

::: {.proposition #prop-unique}
The solution is unique.
:::

::: {.conjecture #conj-prime}
There are infinitely many twin primes.
:::

::: {.remark #rem-note}
This result generalizes to higher dimensions.
:::

::: {.example #ex-simple}
Consider $f(x) = x^2$ on $[0,1]$.
